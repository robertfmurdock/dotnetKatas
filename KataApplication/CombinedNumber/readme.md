# Combined Number Kata

## Value Story

As a team-building facilitator, I want a way to show that together we are greater than the sum of our parts so that I can quickly impress upon the group that teamwork and collaboration have immense and unexpected value.

## Exercise

Write a function accepting a list of non negative integers, and returning their largest possible combined number as a string.

For example:

- given `[50, 2, 1, 9]` it returns `"95021"`    (9 + 50 + 2 + 1)
- given `[5, 50, 56]`   it returns `"56550"`    (56 + 5 + 50)
- given `[420, 42, 423]` it returns `"42423420"` (42 + 423 + 420)
